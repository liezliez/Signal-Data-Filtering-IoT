# Signal-Data-Filtering-IoT
Removing Noises from the Data of Gait Angle Data Signal using LPF or MVA method

# What is it?
In this code im implementing a Lowpass Filter and Moving Average Filter to remove the unwanted signal/noise from a combination of Accelerometer  
and Gyroscope Sensor of a Smartphone for normalize the Gait Angle Result.

# Collecting The Data
My method to collecting the data is using an app "Phyphox" while the Smartphone is tied to the Subject ankle

To retrieve gait data using a smartphone, make sure you are in
conditions running straight constantly at a speed of about 1.5 m/s
