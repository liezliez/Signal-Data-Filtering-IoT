# What is it?
Data filtering is the process of choosing a smaller part of your data set and using that subset for viewing or analysis. Filtering is generally (but not always) temporary – the complete data set is kept, but only part of it is used for the calculation

In this program, im implementing a Lowpass Filter and Moving Average Filter using python to remove unwanted signal/noise   
from some dataset.

# How to  
Use .csv file for the input dataset, 
Run the MVA and LPF section function, the result is shown inside the plot and dataframe

# Example
i also provide the dataset example on this project.  
use the 13.csv file inside this repositories
