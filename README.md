# Signal-Data-Filtering-IoT
Removing Noises from the Data of any numerical Signal using LPF or MVA method

# What is it?
In this code im implementing a Lowpass Filter and Moving Average Filter to remove the unwanted signal/noise from a combination of Accelerometer  
and Gyroscope Sensor of a Smartphone.

My method to collecting the data is using an app "Phyphox" while the Smartphone is tied to the Subject ankle
